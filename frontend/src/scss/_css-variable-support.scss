// There are some "Gotchas" when dealing with css variables
// - don't work with sass color functions (i.e. mix, fade-out, darken, etc)
// - don't work with variable manipulation (i.e. to-lower-case)
// - in fact, sass functions don't work at all with css-variables
// - if you need sass functions, run them with raw values before assigning to css-variables


// So we have some simple fixes to get this to work
