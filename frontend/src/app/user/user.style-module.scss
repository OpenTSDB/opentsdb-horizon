//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// NOTE: First time only after creating this file,
// after you have completed the three steps below
// be sure to add this file to src/app/app.style-module.scss
// and follow the steps in that file

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT MODULE COMPONENT SCSS FILES
// import your component scss
// example: @import './components/componentName/componentName.component.scss';

// containers
//@import './containers/user/user.component';

// components


// widget specific styles are in shared/modules/dynamic-widgets

// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin user-module-core() {
    // include your core mixins
    // example: @include componentName-component-core();

    // containers
    //@include app-user-component-base();

    // components

}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin user-module-theme($theme-config) {
    // include your theme mixins, passing along the $theme-config
    // example: @include componentName-component-theme($theme-config);

    // container
    //@include app-user-component-theme($theme-config);

    // components

}
