//* LANDING PAGE STYLE MODULE LOADER */
//*
//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// NOTE: First time only after creating this file,
// after you have completed the three steps below
// be sure to add this file to src/app/app.style-module.scss
// and follow the steps in that file

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT MODULE COMPONENT SCSS FILES
// import your component scss
// example: @import './components/componentName/componentName.component.scss';

// containers
@import 'containers/landing-page/landing-page.component';

// components
// @import 'components/home/home.component.scss';
@import 'components/activity-panel/activity-panel.component';
@import 'components/pin-panel/pin-panel.component';
@import 'components/landing-page-content/landing-page-content.component';

// widgets

// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin landing-page-module-core() {
  // include your core mixins
  // example: @include componentName-component-core();

  // containers
    @include landing-page-container-component-base();

  // components
  //  @include landing-page-home-component-base();
    @include activity-panel-component-base();
    @include pin-panel-component-base();
    @include landing-page-content-component-base();

  // widgets
}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin landing-page-module-theme($theme-config) {
  // include your theme mixins, passing along the $theme-config
  // example: @include componentName-component-theme($theme-config);

  // container
    @include landing-page-container-component-theme($theme-config);

  // components
  //  @include landing-page-home-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include activity-panel-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include pin-panel-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include landing-page-content-component-theme($theme-config);

  // widgets
}
