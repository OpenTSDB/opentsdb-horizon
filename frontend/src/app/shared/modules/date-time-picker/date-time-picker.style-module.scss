//* SHARED COMPONENTS STYLE MODULE LOADER */
//*
//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// NOTE: First time only after creating this file,
// after you have completed the three steps below
// be sure to add this file to src/app/app.style-module.scss
// and follow the steps in that file

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT MODULE COMPONENT SCSS FILES
// import your component scss
// example: @import './components/componentName/componentName.component.scss';

@import 'date-time-picker.common';
@import './components/date-picker-2/datepicker.component';
@import './components/keypad/keypad.component';
@import './components/time-picker/time-picker.component';
@import './components/time-range-picker/time-range-picker.component';


// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin date-time-picker-module-core() {
    @include date-time-picker-common-base();
    @include date-picker-component-base();
    @include keypad-component-base();
    @include time-picker-component-base();
    @include time-range-picker-component-base();
}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin date-time-picker-module-theme($theme-config) {
    @include date-time-picker-common-theme($theme-config);
    @include date-picker-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include keypad-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include time-picker-component-theme($theme-config);
    @include time-range-picker-component-theme($theme-config);
}
