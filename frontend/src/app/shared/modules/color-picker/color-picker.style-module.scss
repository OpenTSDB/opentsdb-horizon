//* SHARED COMPONENTS STYLE MODULE LOADER */
//*
//* NOTE: Why are there two different mixins?
//*
//* Structure mixins are included only once in app-core(),
//* whereas theme mixins get included as many times
//* as there are themes in the themeloop.
//* Primarily it is just to help reduce code duplication

// NOTE: First time only after creating this file,
// after you have completed the three steps below
// be sure to add this file to src/app/app.style-module.scss
// and follow the steps in that file

// [ STEP 1 ] - IMPORT MODULE COMPONENT SCSS FILES
// import your component scss
// example: @import './components/componentName/componentName.component.scss';

//@import './containers/color-picker/color-picker.component';
//@import './components/color-picker-hue-slider/color-picker-hue-slider.component';
//@import './components/color-picker-hsv-selector/color-picker-hsv-selector.component';
//@import './components/color-picker-selector/color-picker-selector.component';

// [ STEP 2 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S BASE MIXINS (aka structure)
@mixin color-picker-module-core() {
    //@include color-picker-component-base();
    //@include color-picker-hsv-selector-component-base();
    //@include color-picker-hue-slider-component-base();
    //@include color-picker-selector-component-base();
}

// [ STEP 3 ] - ADD COMPONENT'S THEME MIXINS (aka look-n-feel)
@mixin color-picker-module-theme($theme-config) {
    //@include color-picker-component-theme($theme-config);
    //@include color-picker-hsv-selector-component-theme($theme-config);
    //@include color-picker-hue-slider-component-theme($theme-config);
    //@include color-picker-selector-component-theme($theme-config);
}
